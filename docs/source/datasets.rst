Datasets
========

`mlcg.datasets` contains a template `InMemoryDataset` for CLN025, a 10 amino acid long mini protein that shows prototypical folding and unfolding behavior. The `ChignolinDataset` class illustrates how a general dataset can be downloaded, unpacked/organized, transformed/processed, and collated for training models. `Here <https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/create_dataset.html>`_, users can find more information on implementing custom datasets.

Chignolin Dataset
-----------------

Dataset of 3744 individual all-atom trajectories simulated using [ACEMD]_ using the adaptive sampling strategy described in [AdaptiveStrategy]_ . All trajectories were simulated at 350K with [CHARM22Star]_ in a cubic box of 40 angstroms :sup:`3` with 1881 TIP3P water molecules and two Na :sup:`+` ions using a Langevin integrator with an integration timestep of 4 fs, a damping constant of 0.1 :sup:`-1` ps, heavy-hydrogen constraints, and a PME cutoff of 9 angstroms and a PME mesh grid of 1 angstrom. The total aggregate simulation time is 187.2 us.

Alanine Dipeptide Dataset
-------------------------
Dataset of a single 1M step trajectory of alanine dipeptide in explicit water. The trajectory is simulated using a Langevin scheme with [ACEMD]_ at 300K through the [AMBER_ff_99SB_ILDN]_ force force field. The cubic simulation box was 2.3222 cubic nm, an integration timestep of 2 fs was used, the solvent was composed of 651 [TIP3P]_ water molecules, electrostatics were computed every two steps using the PME method with a real-space cutoff of 9 nm and a grid spacing of 0.1 nm, and all bonds between heavy and hydrogen atoms were constrained.

Custom H5 Dataset
-----------------
Users may assemble their own curated dataset using an H5 format. This allows for the possiblity of training on multiple types of molecules or data from different system conditiions.
