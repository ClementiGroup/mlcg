These energies are stored in the `out` field of an `AtomicData` instance that passes through the energy model. In this way, it is natural to think of models as objects that update `AtomicData` instances (by populating them with new attributes/predictions). However, to train our model using force matching we must extract CG forces from the predicted CG energies through a gradient operation. To achieve this, we wrap our SchNet model with a `GradientsOut` object. `GradientsOut` simply requires an energy model and a list of prediction targets that can be acquired through gradient operations. In this case, we specify our gradient wrapper to calculate the CG forces. In pricple, any model can be wrapped by any operation, as data outputs are always stored in `AtomicData.out`, so it is possible to retreive higher order gradients or transform the energy into other physical properties:"

    "To combine our network and prior models, we can use the `SumOut` class defined in `mlcg.nn.gradients`. `SumOut` aggregates the properties predicted in `AtomicData.out` over multiple models, allowing for multiple force terms that maybe represented by several networks or prior models. For simplicity, we use a helper method from `mlcg.pl` to produce our final model for simulation. In principle, `SumOut` can be used to combine arbitrary models together - once again taking advantage of the fact that the output of each model is stored individually in `AtomicData.out` by model name."
